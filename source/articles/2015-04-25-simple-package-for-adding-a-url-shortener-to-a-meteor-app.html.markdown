# Url Shortener for Meteor

Recently I was tasked with adding a url shortener to a Meteor app and I decided to package up my solution so that others could use it as well. You can find the package on Atmosphere [here](https://atmospherejs.com/ryanswapp/url-shortener).

I also created a video tutorial on how to use it...
